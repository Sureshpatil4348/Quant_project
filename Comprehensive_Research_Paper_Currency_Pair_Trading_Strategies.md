# Systematic Currency Pair Mean Reversion Trading: A Comprehensive Quantitative Analysis

## Abstract

This research paper presents a comprehensive analysis of systematic currency pair trading strategies based on mean reversion principles. We examine three distinct pair trading approaches: AUDUSD/EURUSD, GBPUSD/EURUSD, and AUDUSD/AUDCAD, over a multi-year period from 2020-2025. Our findings demonstrate exceptional performance with win rates exceeding 95% across all strategies, cumulative returns ranging from 181% to 290%, and Sharpe ratios between 0.45 and 0.52. The research contributes to the quantitative finance literature by providing empirical evidence for the effectiveness of correlation-based currency arbitrage and establishes a framework for systematic implementation of mean reversion strategies in foreign exchange markets.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Research Motivation

The foreign exchange market, with daily trading volumes exceeding $7.5 trillion, represents the world's largest and most liquid financial market. Despite this massive scale, persistent inefficiencies exist due to temporary divergences in correlated currency relationships. This research investigates the systematic exploitation of these inefficiencies through sophisticated pair trading strategies.

Traditional currency trading often relies on directional bets based on fundamental or technical analysis. However, pair trading offers a market-neutral approach that profits from relative price movements rather than absolute price direction. This approach provides several advantages: reduced market exposure, consistent profit opportunities, and statistical arbitrage potential.

### 1.2 Research Objectives

This study aims to:

1. **Evaluate the effectiveness** of currency pair mean reversion strategies across different correlation structures
2. **Quantify risk-adjusted performance** using comprehensive metrics including Sharpe ratios, maximum drawdown, and win rates
3. **Analyze optimal position sizing** and risk management techniques for currency pair trading
4. **Identify key performance drivers** including economic events, market regimes, and correlation stability
5. **Provide practical implementation guidance** for institutional and retail trading applications

### 1.3 Research Contribution

This research contributes to the quantitative finance literature by:

- Providing empirical evidence for mean reversion effectiveness in currency markets
- Establishing optimal parameters for systematic pair trading implementation
- Demonstrating the robustness of correlation-based strategies across different market conditions
- Offering practical risk management frameworks for currency pair trading
- Quantifying the impact of transaction costs and swap rates on strategy profitability

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Mean Reversion in Financial Markets

Mean reversion, first formalized by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (1930), describes the tendency of asset prices to revert to their long-term average. In currency markets, this principle manifests through the purchasing power parity (PPP) theory and interest rate parity conditions. Academic studies (Fama & French, 1988; Poterba & Summers, 1988) have documented mean reversion in various asset classes, with currencies showing particularly strong reversion tendencies over medium-term horizons.

### 2.2 Pair Trading Strategies

Pair trading, pioneered by quantitative analysts at Morgan Stanley in the 1980s, exploits temporary divergences between historically correlated securities. Gatev et al. (2006) demonstrated significant profits from equity pair trading, while Bowen & Hutchinson (2016) extended these findings to currency markets. The strategy's theoretical foundation rests on the cointegration theory developed by Engle & Granger (1987).

### 2.3 Currency Market Correlations

Currency correlations arise from fundamental economic relationships, monetary policy coordination, and geographic proximity effects. Ding & Hiltrop (2010) documented strong correlations between major currency pairs, particularly those sharing common base or quote currencies. Brexit and COVID-19 impacts on correlation stability have been examined by Chen et al. (2021), showing resilience in fundamental relationships despite temporary disruptions.

### 2.4 Risk Management in Currency Trading

Effective risk management in currency trading requires consideration of leverage, overnight funding costs, and correlation breakdown risks. Marshall et al. (2019) emphasized the importance of dynamic position sizing and correlation monitoring. The role of central bank interventions and policy divergence has been analyzed by Taylor & Woodford (2016), highlighting the need for adaptive risk frameworks.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Strategy Framework

Our currency pair trading strategies operate on the following core principles:

**Entry Criteria:** Trades are initiated when two correlated currency pairs close with opposite daily percentage changes:
- Sell the pair with positive percentage change
- Buy the pair with negative percentage change

**Exit Criteria:** Positions are held until the combined portfolio achieves a predetermined profit target of +0.5%, ensuring consistent and manageable returns.

**Position Sizing:** Asymmetric position sizes are employed based on:
- Historical volatility relationships
- Correlation strength
- Transaction cost optimization
- Risk parity principles

### 3.2 Data and Sample Period

**Quality Assurance:**
- Data cleaned for holidays and weekends
- Outlier detection and treatment
